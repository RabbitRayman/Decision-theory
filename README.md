# Decision-theory

An application designed to solve the problem of making decisions under risk conditions, when the probabilities with which nature accepts each of the possible states are known, using several criteria:

1. The Wald Criterion
2. The Savage Criterion
3. Hurwitz criterion
4. The Bayes criterion
5. The Laplace criterion

Matrix Q - "payment matrix".
The matrix p is the probability matrix for the Bayes criterion.
The lam variable is a lambda for the Hurwitz criterion.

The program allows you to consider any number of strategies and states of nature. The only condition is that the number of columns in the matrices Q and p matches.
